# Project Guidance
- This is a React + Vite + TypeScript project for a campus rewards dashboard.
- The design should be a creative, professional, business-class dark theme (black/yup'R style).
- Prioritize beautiful, modern UI, creative layouts, and smooth user experience.
- Use component-based structure and keep code modular and maintainable.
- Integrate Firebase for authentication and data.
- Dashboard, rewards, leaderboard, and admin features should be implemented as React components.
- Use modern CSS (CSS modules, styled-components, or Tailwind CSS) for styling.
- Animations and transitions should be smooth and professional.
- Accessibility and responsiveness are important.
