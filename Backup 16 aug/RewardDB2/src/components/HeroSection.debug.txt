Debug checklist for HeroSection background animation:

1. The HeroSection component uses a single div.hero-bg for the background, and changes its backgroundImage style every 5 seconds.
2. The CSS uses transition on background-image, but CSS cannot animate background-image changes smoothly between two images. Only opacity or transform can be animated.
3. To achieve a smooth crossfade, two absolutely positioned divs are needed: one for the current image, one for the next, and animate opacity between them.
4. The current implementation will cause the image to switch instantly, not fade.

Solution:
- Refactor HeroSection to render two divs: one for the current image, one for the next, and animate opacity for a true crossfade.
- Animate opacity for a slow, smooth transition.
- On click, keep the current image visible with higher opacity.
